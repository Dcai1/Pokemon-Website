## About This Website

This is a simple Pokémon site that displays various Pokémons from different regions in the official Pokémon games.

I started it alone as a passion project.

It calls and uses an API to load Pokémons and their details.

The current functions of this website lists Pokémon on their respective pages. Clicking on one will display their details including their types, abilities, and locations.

If additional information is required, such as move descriptions or generally more information, a link to the Pokémon Database is provided.

### This project was built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind.
